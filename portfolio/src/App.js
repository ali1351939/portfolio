        systems using computer software, enabling me to visualize and predict the impact of different parameters.
        This necessitates a deep engagement with various computer software tools.
        Recognizing the continuous evolution of programming languages and software, I took the initiative 
        to update my knowledge in this domain. I pursued studies in software development at Vanier College
         in Montreal, renowned for its excellence in education in this field. This allowed me to acquaint
          myself with the latest generation of programming languages and other computer-related sciences. 
          In today's technology-driven landscape, a comprehensive understanding of concepts like databases,
           data structures, internet networks, operating systems, and cybersecurity is indispensable for 
           effective computer work.

        Beyond software development, one of my passions lies in scientific and research endeavors.
         I actively seek collaboration with universities and research centers, engaging in projects focused
          on {' '}
